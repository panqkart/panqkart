A merge of all the vehicles from:

- "Mesecars" by paramat.
- "Car" by Esteban.
- "Boats" by PilzAdam.
- "Hovercraft" by Stuart Jones.

- 28 vehicles currently.
- All CAR01's can carry 3 passengers.

- Disable vehicles by going to your Minetest Settings.
- Adding new vehicles is a simple matter of:
  - Create/acquire vehicle model and textures.
  - Create, and name appropriately, a new `.lua` file on its appropiate folder for the vehicle based on one of the existing ones.
  - Add a setting in `settingtypes.txt` for users to enable/disable it.
  - Change settings in the file you created to reflect the new vehicle.
  - Add a new line to `init.lua` to load the vehicle `dofile(minetest.get_modpath("vehicle_mash") .. "/NAME_OF_VEHICLE.lua")`

## Installation

- Unzip the archive, rename the folder to `vehicle_mash` and place it in
../minetest/mods/

- GNU/Linux: If you use a system-wide installation place
it in ~/.minetest/mods/.

- If you only want this to be used in a single world, place
the folder in worldmods/ in your world directory.

As far as the work I did... It's really just a fork of a fork of a fork of a fork, tossed it all into a blender and spun it on puree for a bit. Baked it for a while and set it on the counter to cool. What I mean is, make what you will of it, it matters not to me.
