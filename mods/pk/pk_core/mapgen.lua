--- @brief The core function to initialize the spawnpoint
--- and place the player on the spawnpoint.
--- @details The function will check for:
--- 1. A world-exclusive file that saves the lobby position.
--- 2. A value in the Minetest settings (DEPRECATED).
--- 3. Global variable that was updated each time the `spawn_node` node was detected (DEPRECATED).
--- If none of these are found/valid, it will use a fallback position, or the current player's position.
--- @param player userdata the player that will be teleported to the lobby
--- @param time number the time in seconds that the player will be teleported to the lobby
--- @return nil
