= StreetsMod relaunch: ToDo =

== Legend ==
✓      | Done
...    | In Progress
-      | Not Done
*      | Comment

== 1. General =
✓ create a new folder structure that is: easy to understand, easy to extend,  easily configurable (important later on...)
✓ find suitable licenses for media/code: CC-BY-SA 3.0 seems to be fine for media, not sure which license I should choose for the code though...
✓ create new 16px textures; many people asked for it...
? use kaeza's intllib
- use Rubendwardy's achievements

== 2. API ==
✓ create a simple API that makes registration of road surfaces and markings easier by automatically registering all needed combinations of surfaces and markings
✓ enable the developer to register a whole set of surfaces and their markings or vide-versa using two functions: streets.register_surface() and streets.register_marking()

== 3. Nodes ==
✓ adapt all existing nodes to the new API and finally find a good naming convention for the nodes, e.g. ":streets:surface_surfacecolor_marking_markingcolor_x"

=== 3.1 Road surfaces ===
✓ standard asphalt (black)
✓ colored asphalt (red, yellow, blue) to mark special areas, like bike paths etc.

=== 3.2 Road markings ===
✓ The following nodes are available in white and yellow
✓ Arrows: left, right, straight on, straight on + left, straight on + right, straight on + left + right, left + right
✓ Middle lines: solid, dashed, double solid, double dashed, double mixed
✓ Side lines: solid slim, solid thick, dashed slim, dashed thick, outer edge thick, outer edge thin, inner edge thick, inner edge thin
✓ Others: Parking, Forbidden area, crosswalk

=== 3.3 Roadworks ===
✓ Overriding markings: all from 3.2 but only in yellow
✓ drawtypes: raillike (for middle lines) or nodebox (Minetest lacks a drawtype that combines raillike and facedir)
- Roadwork related accessories: Fences, pylons, lights, Vertical bars, etc.

=== 3.4 Concrete ===
✓ nothing new here: concrete blocks and walls as known from 1.5 and below
✓ use walls API for concrete walls

=== 3.5 Passive road accessories ===
✓ find a style that is not too country specific but still easy for everyone to understand
  * Possibly include the old signs, but maybe with some country specific? I'd love to have at least some of the most common USA ones in there. (cheapie)
  * Let's forget to be un-country-specific. Let's include US and EU ones, that should satisfy many players. We can make the sign workshop use tabs to organise them into categories and a dropdown to select the set to be used. (wd97)
✓ Warning signs: "!", lava, water, construction area, curves, railroad crossings, crosswalks, "Baken"
✓ Traffic: "STOP", "Railroad", "Give way", "right of way", "Priority", "One way", "roundabout (a square of course)", "dead end", "Parking"
- Writable using signs_lib (hopefully?): city entrance/exit, street name, guideposts
* Especially in this category, the list of signs is subject to change. If something is not possible due to graphical or technical limitations, it won't get implemented.
* Spontaneous ideas of mine are possible and very likely...
✓ Traffic barriers
✓ delineators

=== 3.6 Active road accessories
✓ Traffic guidance system for highways, controllable via digilines
 * = streets/laneuse
✓ Trafficlight (off, red, yellow, green)
✓? (ambiguous) Trafficlight (off, red, yellow)
✓ Compact and portable trafficlight (e.g. for roadworks)
✓ Blinking light (off, yellow)
✓ bollards

=== 3.7 Railroad crossings ===
✓ Controllable barriers (manual (punch) or mesecons)
✓ Blinking lights (off, red) with single or double lamps

=== 3.8 Bridges ===
- Drawbridges. Definetely cool, but not easy to implement because of lack of facedir for many nodes and brdiges thicker than 1m... This one needs a seperate plan
  * Might be best in a separate mod (cheapie)
  * Would be the best solution... (wd97)
