# Streets mod 2.0
_Released on 21st of February 2017_

_Streets 2.0 is **not** fully backwards-compatible to streets 1.x!_

**NOTE:** This mod depends on the [ts_workshop](https://github.com/minetest-mods/ts_workshop) mod.

To improve loading time and reduce the number of registered nodes,
this mod only registers stairsplus nodes for very basic roadmarkings.
If you want to have all possible nodes registered, you can set
the setting `streets.only_basic_stairsplus` to false in `minetest.conf`.
