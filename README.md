## 🏁 Making your own maps 🏁

### ❕ A new guide will be created soon as well as a multiple-map system

If you want to make a new level/map for our game (or just for yourself), that's amazing! We have basic tools list below to get you started.\
In the future, we will add multiple maps which will playable! Thank you for your interest in adding back to our community.

I recommend the following tools/knowledge for the same:

- [Streets](https://github.com/minetest-mods/streets) is one of the greatest streets mod for Minetest out there. It's fully customizable and includes street signals, concrete, asphalt, and so much more things.
- [Map Tools](https://github.com/minetest-mods/maptools) is a great utility mod that includes lots of special nodes used for building, moderation, administrator pickaxe, and more.
- Minetest Forums: [Map Category](https://forum.minetest.net/viewforum.php?f=12), which can help you in getting inspired by other maps or levels. Don't forget to check out its licenses before doing anything!
- [WorldEdit](https://github.com/Uberi/Minetest-WorldEdit) is an ultimate in-game world editing tool that can help you build faster and better.
- [More Blocks](https://github.com/minetest-mods/moreblocks) includes 100+ special blocks with different functionalities that help you make better buildings with more efficiency.
- [Tree Capitator](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Hybrid%20Dog/treecapitator/), which destroys the whole tree when you destroy the root trunk.

To add special modifications, such as animals, special overrides, the in-game builder privilege, etc., you may want to install the [`servermods`](https://github.com/panqkart/servermods) modpack in your server.

**Note: the `maptools:white` and `maptools:black` nodes are used when ending a race.**\
Hopefully, we will soon make a detailed tutorial on making your own map!

As always, if you need any help, do let us know about it and we will be glad to help!
